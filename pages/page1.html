      <h1>By Association</h1>
      <h2>How does an individual become part of a group?</h2>
      <p class="pg-content">Just as there are an infinite number of personal interests and beliefs that can be seen
        among Americans
        collectively, there are thousands and thousands of organizations and groups to which citizens can
        belong. The terms group and organization are very loose and can be interpreted very broadly. Some groups
        are very general and open to all without question while others may have specific goals or very selective
        membership. They can be economically motivated, socially focused, or even one-issue organizations.
        However, we can break them down into political organizations, interest groups, voluntary and civic
        associations, unions, and religious groups. View the slideshow below to learn more.

            <h3>Political Organizations</h3>
            <p>Political organizations have the general goal of trying to either influence or take control of
              government to achieve outcomes. Political parties, such as the Democrats, Republicans, and
              Libertarians, all fall in the category, but one might also find groups such as FreedomWorks or
              the Center for American Progress. Depending on the group or organization, citizens may find
              membership in them a challenge as political parties often take time to join in an active level,
              or groups may insist on alignment with philosophical goals.

            <h3>Interest Groups</h3>
            <p>Interest groups tend to be centered on a common goal or idea. These groups run the table in
              terms of interests and
              concerns, including the National Organization for Women, La Raza, National Right to Life, and
              the National Rifle
              Association. Many could be considered political as they have aims to influence leadership.
              However, membership tends
              to be less restrictive as many look for volunteers to help spread their messages and ideas.

            <h3>Voluntary and Civic Associations</h3>
            <p>Volunteering and civic participation tends to be the most local level of group membership.
              Often
              parts of larger organizations, these groups are often charitable, and work for general causes,
              or serve as a means of
              fraternal support. Such groups differ widely, with some very open to anyone interested, such as
              the Red Cross or United
              Way, and others with very selective membership procedures, such as the Elks or Freemasons.

            <h3>Unions</h3>
            <p>Unions were created to support the needs of workers in various fields of industry and service
              and are responsible
              for helping to promote safe workplaces and fair labor practices. Over the years, unions have
              often increased their
              activities to include charitable works and political involvement to support candidates and ideas
              that serve to aid
              their general membership. Unions include the AFL-CIO and the NEA. Union membership is selective
              in that one must
              usually be employed in a particular field to join; however, in some places union membership is
              actually mandatory by
              state law if employed in certain jobs.

            <h3>Religious Groups</h3>
            <p>Religious groups is a very broad category as it can refer to specific religious denominations
              or sects, or it can
              refer to organizations and societies that support the views of particular religions and belief
              systems. For example,
              entire denominations have lobbying organizations to petition on their behalf. Other
              organizations exist to promote
              the ideas of a religious group, such as the Anti-Defamation League, which exists to prevent
              persecution of Jewish
              citizens, and the Knights of Columbus, an association of Catholic men. Generally, membership in
              groups requires
              adherence to the beliefs of the sect or denomination, but some have more stringent requirements
              for participation.

        <button id="revealer">Reveal Answer</button>
        <p id="answer" style="display: none;">Yes. Many organizations could fall under the idea of political
          organizations
          or interest groups since they
          tend to
          aim for political influence and focus on areas of common interest. However, some are more explicitly
          political,
          while others have politics as a goal among many.
