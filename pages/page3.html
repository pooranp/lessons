      <h1>Words to Know</h1>
      <h2>What words should you know to appreciate the rest of Part I of the novel?</h2>
      <p class="pg-content">Although Miyax has finally made friends with Amaroq and the other wolves in his pack, she
        is
        still struggling to survive. Getting Jello to share some meat from his "belly basket" had been a desperate
        and
        dangerous move on her part, and she can't rely on this method forever. The next time she tries, he might
        attack
        her instead of giving in to his "babysitting" instincts. <br><br>Throughout the rest of Part I of Julie of
        the Wolves,
        the protagonist continues her quest to stay alive in spite of the harshness of the elements, a shortage of
        food,
        and her loneliness. Some of the words below may be unfamiliar to you, and yet they will be helpful in
        understanding Miyax's difficult situation even after winning Amaroq's trust.
